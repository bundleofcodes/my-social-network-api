# my-social-network-api

## Description

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of an API design to create a social network application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts and create a friend list. The user can create the API using Mongoose object data modeling library (ODM). This application uses `Node.js`to run the server on the backend. `Express.js` is implemented for routing, a `MongoDB` database, the `Mongoose` package to effectively provide a schema-based solution to model application data, `Moment.js` to format timestamps, then the seed data is created using `Insomnia`.
